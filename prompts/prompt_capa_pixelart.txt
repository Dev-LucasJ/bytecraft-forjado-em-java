Pixel art of a meditating warrior near calm water, inspired by a samurai and Jedi.  
The character sits cross-legged in black robes with glowing purple accents,  
eyes closed in deep concentration.  

No lightsaber or weapon is shown.  
The scene is calm and introspective,  
with colors inspired by the Java logo:  
red rising sun in the background, white mist, and dark shadows.  

Add serene natural elements like stones, bamboo, or distant temple silhouettes.  
16-bit pixel art style, focused on atmosphere and minimalism.
